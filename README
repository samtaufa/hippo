Hippo is a host repository for tracking system configuration files.

Overview
========

Hippo is a thin layer built on top of Git that simplifies managing a host-wide
repository of files with metadata (permissions and ownership). Conceptually,
Hippo simply serializes metadata before certain Git commands are run, and
restores file metadata after others. By default, the host-wide git repository
lives in __/var/hippo/.git__, metadata is tracked in __/var/hippo/manifest__.


Usage
=====

Hippo requires privileged access to checked-in files, so all commands below
should be run as root. Most Hippo commands are identical to their Git
equivalents:

## Initialise a new host repository

    hippo init

## Add a file

    hippo add /etc/inetd.conf

## Commit

    hippo commit -a 

## Push to a remote host

    hippo push aldo@remotehost:repo

## Inspect a hippo repository with git

A Hippo repository is just a Git repo, with a bit of added structure. You can
check out a hippo repository using Git, and inspect or even modify the included
files and metadata log:

    git clone aldo@remotehost:repo

## Flash a configuration checked into Hippo onto a new system

    hippo clone aldo@remotehost:repo
